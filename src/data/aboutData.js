    content: [
      "Koodu Architecture was born from a desire to create spaces that feel rooted, alive, and limitless in imagination.",
      "Founded in Tamil Nadu, Koodu (meaning 'nest' in Tamil) reflects our belief in architecture as shelter, community, and creation — a space for making, dreaming, and belonging.",
      "From architecture to furniture,, we work across scales and mediums, blending traditional wisdom with emerging technologies. Our practice is grounded in material curiosity, hands-on experimentation, and collaboration with craftspeople and clients alike.",
      "We approach each project as a living inquiry — an opportunity to learn, adapt, and create something meaningful, lasting, and deeply human."

    bio: [
      "Arjun's journey with architecture began with a deep love for building and making — with his hands, his heart, and his imagination. From crafting intricate furniture in wood to fabricating complex structures, he brings an intuitive understanding of materials, tools, and tectonics to every project.",
      "Koodu is Arjun's brainchild — a studio born from curiosity, experimentation, and a desire to create spaces that are both rooted and visionary. His work sits at the intersection of tradition and innovation, blending craft with technology to shape thoughtful, human-scale environments.",
      "To Arjun, architecture is not just about designing — it's about doing about imagining boldly, building honestly, and making things that last."

      "Tharun is a designer, builder, and thinker who moves fluidly between the digital and the physical. With a background in computational design and a passion for technology, he brings systems-level thinking to architecture, always seeking elegant logic beneath expressive form.",
      "At Koodu, Tharun leads the studio's explorations in digital fabrication, generative design, and automation. Whether he's scripting geometry, prototyping a 3D-printed object, or designing workflows for large-scale projects, his approach is hands-on, experimental, and always human-centred.",
      "For Tharun, architecture is code and craft — a space where ideas are built, broken, tested, and refined. His vision is to shape a future where tradition, computation, and craft exist in powerful harmony."
